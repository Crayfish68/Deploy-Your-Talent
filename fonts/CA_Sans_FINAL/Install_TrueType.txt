22 April 2010re:Manually installing our new corporate font CA Sans

A TrueType version of CA Sans is available for use with software and systems which cannot accommodate an OpenType font format (this includes PowerPoint 2007, which has problems using OpenType fonts). 
Easy Install
Windows automatically installs the fonts into the system if you copy the fonts into Control Panel > Fonts. (In most instances, the font becomes active and available without even restarting.)
1. Go to the Start button and click it.
2. Choose Settings and Control Panel.
3. Choose Fonts
4. Unzip the fonts and copy the font documents into the Fonts folder. You should see a message that the fonts are being installed.
Legacy Install
1. Via Start > Settings > select Control Panels
2. Double-click on Fonts
3. When open, under File > select Install New Fonts…
4. Via window, browse to the CA Fonts Folder 
(If it’s on your desktop – C: > Documents and Settings > [your PMF key] > Desktop > Double click the CA Fonts Folder)
5. Once the folder is selected it may take a few seconds, then all four CA Sans font options – Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic should show up in the top window
6. Click the Select All button at the right (the Copy Fonts to Fonts folder should be checked by default; if not, check it now)
7. Click Install
